# About

Hi. I'm <strong>Paulos</strong> - a software engineer, web developer and windows experimenter from Athens, Greece. I'm a full-stack developer at the moment. I know HTML, CSS, Python, C++, C. I have always been interested in technology from a very young age.

I work on all types of different projects. They're used for improving security and user's experiences.

## FAQ
Why are you called SrpCD?<br>
\> When I was younger, I wanted to be a scripter. I named myself CDScripterYT and shortened to SrpCD.

When are you going to release applications?<br>
\> Maybe one day I will. I take developing applications seriously. Check out my projects here.
